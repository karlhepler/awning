# Weather Automation Configuration
# ==============================================================================
# The automation opens the awning ONLY if ALL 5 conditions are met:
#   1. ✓ Sunny (cloud cover below threshold)
#   2. ✓ Calm (wind speed below threshold)
#   3. ✓ No rain (precipitation = 0 mm/h)
#   4. ✓ Daytime (current time between sunrise and sunset)
#   5. ✓ Sun facing SE (sun azimuth 90°-180° for southeast-facing window)
#
# If ANY condition fails, the awning will close.
# ==============================================================================

# Location - Used for weather data AND sun position calculation
# Find your coordinates at https://www.latlong.net/ or Google Maps (right-click → coordinates)
LATITUDE=37.7749
LONGITUDE=-122.4194

# Cloud cover threshold (0-100%) - Controls "Sunny" condition
# Awning opens if cloud cover is BELOW this percentage
# Typical values: 20-40% (30% is a good default for mostly sunny)
CLOUD_COVER_THRESHOLD=30

# Wind speed threshold (mph) - Controls "Calm" condition
# Awning opens if wind speed is BELOW this speed
# IMPORTANT: Set conservatively below your awning's built-in wind sensor (typically 30 mph)
# Typical values: 8-12 mph (10 mph is a safe default for most residential awnings)
WIND_SPEED_THRESHOLD_MPH=10

# Rain threshold - Hardcoded to 0 mm/h (any precipitation closes awning)
# This cannot be configured - any rain detection will close the awning

# Daytime - Automatically determined from sunrise/sunset times
# No configuration needed - uses weather API data for your location

# Sun position - Hardcoded to 90°-180° azimuth range
# This is for a southeast-facing window (sun shines from East to South)
# East = 90°, Southeast = 135°, South = 180°
# If your window faces a different direction, you'll need to modify the code

# ==============================================================================
# Cron Job Setup Example
# ==============================================================================
# First, create a logs directory: mkdir -p ~/logs
#
# Then add to your crontab (crontab -e):
#
# Option 1: Specify .env file path explicitly (RECOMMENDED for cron)
# */15 * * * * nix run /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/path/to/awning#automation -- --env-file=/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/path/to/awning/.env >> ~/logs/awning-automation.log 2>&1
#
# Option 2: Change to project directory (auto-finds .env in current directory)
# */15 * * * * cd /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/path/to/awning && nix run .#automation >> ~/logs/awning-automation.log 2>&1
#
# The automation will only open the awning when ALL conditions are met.
# It checks the current awning state before taking action, so it won't
# repeatedly send open/close commands if the awning is already in the desired state.
